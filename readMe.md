## The Rules: 
- Any live cell with **fewer than two live neighbors dies**, as if caused by under population.
- Any live cell with **more than three live neighbors dies**, as if by overcrowding.
- Any live cell with **two or three live neighbors lives** on to the next generation.
- Any dead cell with **exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell**.
- A cellâ€™s neighbors are those cells which are **horizontally, vertically or diagonally adjacent**. Most cells will have eight neighbors. Cells placed on the edge of the grid will have fewer.


## Input/Output

- The input will be a 2D Array object of . and 0 where they represent dead and alive respectively.
